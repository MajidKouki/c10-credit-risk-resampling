# Credit Risk Resampling

This project is an analysis of peer-to-peer lending data using Logistic Regression and oversampling to identify whether or not oversampling helps the model better predict healthy and risky loans.

## Technologies

This project leverages python with the following packages:

* [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For dataframes.

* [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) - For calculations.

* [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) - For LogisticRegression model and evaluation metrics

* [Imbalanced-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn) - For RandomOverSampler

## Installation Guide

Before first running the application install the following dependencies:

```python
    pip install pandas
    pip install numpy
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install imbalanced-learn
```

Jupyter may be required to view the .ipynb file.

```python
    pip install jupyter
```

## Usage

This project is primarily intended to be used an an analysis and prediction of data as well as presenting a report on the findings. The code and models can be reused with proper modifications to the data and model to fit user's needs. All analysis sections, which contain no code, will need to be removed or changed to fit any changes made to the analysis and code.
